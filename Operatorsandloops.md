### Operators and Loops

**== is equal to** - this operator compares two values to see if they are the same

**!= is not equal to** - this operator compares two values to see if they are not the same

**=== strict equal to** - this operator compares two values to check that both the data type and value are the same

**!== strict not equal to** - this operator compares two values to check that both the data type and value are not the same

**> greater than** - this operator checks if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right

**> less than** - this operator checks if the number on the left is less than the number on the right

**>= greater than or equal to** - this operator checks if the number on the left is greater than or equal to the number on the right.

**<= less than or equal to** - this operator checks if the number on the left is less than or equal to the number on the right

In any condition, there is usually one operator and two operands. The operands are placed on each side of the operator. They can be values or variables. You often see espressions enclosed in parentheses

## Logical operators

Comparison operators usually return single values of true or false. Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator

**&& logival and** - this operator test more than one conditions
