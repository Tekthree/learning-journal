# Computer Architecture and Logic

How do computers work - what makes a computer a computer

Computer break down
- take input
- store in storage
- processing
- output

computers started out as basic calculators

Computers processor takes information from memory, changes the info using algorithm (a series of commands) then it sends the processed information back to be stored in memory again.This continues until the processed info is ready to be output

Computers work on 1 and 0. which represents on or off.  Electric wires and circuits carry all the info in a computer

the info is called a bit. the smallest info a computer can store

Binary number system. any number can be represented with either a 1 or 0

text, images and sound can be represented with binary number system

circuits are millions of electronic components that come together

Logic gates are circuit types

smaller circuits are faster because the electricty has less distance to go

CPU is the central processing unit that calculates information

hardware is speakers, wires, chips, circuits, ect.

software is apps, games, computer programs, webpages

CPU controls all the other parts of a computer

Operating system is the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer
