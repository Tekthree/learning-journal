## Code Along

The code went somewhat smooth for me. I got all my code it but struggled with the file structure in the tree. I had my Js file in the wrong folder and could not get it to load. It helped me learn the importance of setting everything up properly from the very start. I feel about how far I have come in such little time. good stuff  

##  JavaScript & jQuery

JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex features on a website, such as dynamic elements or interactivity.

JavaScript is executed once the information from the HTML and CSS in the source code has been parsed and constructed.

The JavaScript will then trigger any events or variables specified within it, the Document Object Model (DOM) will be updated, and, finally, the JavaScript will be rendered in the browser.

The HTML and CSS will often form the foundations of a page’s structure, and any JavaScript will make the final tweaks and alterations.


javascript-  is an asynchronous, dynamically-typed, interpreted scripting language, designed to make web pages dynamic and interactive.

conditionals- Conditional statements control behavior in JavaScript and determine whether or not pieces of code can run. There are multiple different types of conditionals in JavaScript including: “If” statements: where if a condition is true it is used to specify execution for a block of code.

operators- performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result. For example 1 + 2, where + sign is an operator and 1 is left operand and 2 is right operand.

data types- Data types basically specify what kind of data can be stored and manipulated within a program. … String, Number, and Boolean are primitive data types. Object, Array, and Function (which are all types of objects) are composite data types. Whereas Undefined and Null are special data types.

variable- A variable is a way to programmatically reference a previously assigned value.
