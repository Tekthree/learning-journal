Script is a series of instrustions that a comuter can follow to chieve a goal.

Compare scripts to a recipe for a cake. You have to be specific

To write a script, you need to state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. 
- Define the goal
- Design the script
- Code each step

Once you know the goal of the your script, you can define the task.
Each individual task may be broken down into a sequence of steps.
Use flowcharts to work out how the tasks fit together.

## Expressions
an expression evaluates into a single value
there are two types of expressions
-expressions that just assign a value to a variable - exp - var color = 'beige';
-expressions that use two or more values to return a single value - exp - var area = 3*2;
